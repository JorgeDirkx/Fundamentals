Overview Fundamentals

COLLECTIONS (interface) FRAMEWORK:

- ordered
- sorted

Iterator interface: runs through all the elements. Methods used: hasNext() and next().

List = ordered + duplicates

ArrayList = based on an Array, dynamic adaptation, lenght needs to be changed every time

LinkedList = double connected List, suitable for adding and removing

Set = collection of unique elements, duplicates have the same HashCode (equals method)

HashSet = not ordered, not sorted -->HashCode = index; is a row with elements with the same HashCode
                                                (equals method checks for duplicates)

LinkedHashSet = ordered, not sorted

SortedSet = ordered, sorted

NavigableSet = ordered, sorted + info about other element
